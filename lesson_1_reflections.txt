Viewing a diff between two files helps indentifying areas where a new bug may
have been introduced. So check those locations first when things are "suddenly"
broken.

Other notes:
Use git-bash to get linux style command prompt
on windows you have program called FC. Can be runned from commandline:
>>	FC file-old.js file-new.js
